  <main>
    <p>I am [Your Name], a student in my third year of Aerospace, Economics, and Mathematics. My studies draw me toward questions about energy systems, commodities, and the mathematical frameworks we use to understand productivity and growth.</p>

    <p>Much of my work so far has been in the classroom and in research projects. I am building a foundation across applied mathematics, economic models, and technical domains in aerospace.</p>

    <p>This site is not a portfolio in the startup sense, but a record of study. I use it to collect projects, notes, and readings that matter to me — a way to keep track of what I am learning and to make it visible to others who may share these interests.</p>
